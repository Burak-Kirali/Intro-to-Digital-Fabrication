	<h1> Who is Burak Kirali??</h1>
	<pre>     		 
Hello, I'm Burak from Turkey. I don't how I have started
but since my early ages I've had interest in space. It's
I love doing anything connected to coding, electronics, and math. 
Besides that I really enjoy and apriciate when my insturctors
deliver material in an intiutive and engaging way rather than
lectures.Besides that I really  like diving both scuba and non-scuba. 
I think my record is 9m with one breath and 18m with scuba.
