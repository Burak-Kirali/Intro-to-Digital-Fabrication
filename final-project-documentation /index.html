	<h2> Fix, Steady Go Pro for Diver</h2>
	<pre>
<FONT COLOR=red><b>The problem: </b><FONT COLOR=black> when diving, divers are usually immersed in a beautifull environment 
and they want to capture this environment by a camera (usuualy by a go pro).
However, trying to keep the go-pro with you underwater takes atention from
other important things a diver has to pay atention on such as checking how much 
oxygen has left on their tank or keeping a close distance with their dive-partner
	</pre>	

	<pre>
<FONT COLOR=red><b>The Solution: </b><FONT COLOR=black> I'm thinking about a product where the go-pro is attached 
right above the mask(the water glass) or somewhere in the head and there's special glove or device on the
right hand of the diver. The diver uses their hands or this device to communicate with the go-pro.
It's like pushing a botton to capture a photo and another botton to start and stop recording a video. Or detecting 
hand movement but I have no experience doing that. I plan on communicating beetween the device at hand  by
a wire that goes through the divers right arm to the go-pro. The go-pro and some electronic are in a casing.
The signal is sent to a mictrocontroller which pushes the buttons on the go-pro with the commands given by the hand
