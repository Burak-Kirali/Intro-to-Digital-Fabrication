  <h2>This First Part is Like a Document Where Ä± put my ideas as they come to me</h2>
  <p>
    The user should control it my their thumbs but the movement of the thumb does not alllow
    for the inside of the hand so put different systems at 4 fingers. Like middle for taking a photo
    index finger for zoom in zoom out etc. Put the elctronics inside the hand as that space won't be used
    then from the palce from thumb to index finger send to signal to the thing at head.  
    You have to carefully consider water as the rest of the hand will be exposed to the
    water.

  <h2> I scrapped my go-pro idea because it was expansive</h2>

  <h2> Just some Note Taking</h2>

  <p> From what I've found online we need to use strain gauge's to measure how much force a sensor faces but this process is not as simple as the sensor where the ball hits gives a current
    <br>
    By strain gauges we measure how much the material has deformed by a force because resistance is directly proportional to change in length which is proportional to length.
    So we have data about how much a place on the hoop has deformed due to force and we somewhat how to convert into the place the ball hit by sensors. My idea is That
    the the ball probably will hit somewhere in beetween the sensors so we need find the 2 sensors the ball hit in beetween.
