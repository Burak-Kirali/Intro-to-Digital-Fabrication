    <h1>İmproving Basketball Player's Shooting</h1>
    <hr>
    <br>

    <p>
      For my final project me and Demir wanted to create a project to improve Basketball player's shooting. To achieve this we though of a system
      where the device will show where the ball hit on the basketball, with this the player would see where they hit the ball more and improve their shootings.
      To achieve this we thought of putting 4 accelerometer's into the hoop 90° apart and detect which region of the hoop the ball hit. We ran into many problems and our
      current design can only detect wheather the ball hit close or far away from the hoop. Below is our video, and for detailed in formation about our project here is
      the<a href="../Weeks/week10--Final Project Documentation/index.html">for my documentation.</a>
