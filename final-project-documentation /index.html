  <h2>This First Part is Like a Document Where Ä± put my ideas as they come to me</h2>
  <p>
    The user should control it my their thumbs but the movement of the thumb does not alllow
    for the inside of the hand so put different systems at 4 fingers. Like middle for taking a photo
    index finger for zoom in zoom out etc. Put the elctronics inside the hand as that space won't be used
    then from the palce from thumb to index finger send to signal to the thing at head.  
    You have to carefully consider water as the rest of the hand will be exposed to the
    water.
