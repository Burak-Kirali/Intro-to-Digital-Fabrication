        This week I decided not to CNC my piece for my hoop project because I thought I'll able to 2.5D CNC'ing on metals. Instead I wanted to make a dice for my
        dungeons and dragons club at my high school(the club has the dice but I just wanted to replicate one). Due to nature of dice's I had to cas the same thing twice
        and stick them together and because of this any dice without a flat place to cut on-like 12-sided and 20-sided dice. I also wanted to not make a 4-sided dice nor a cube
        and decided on making a octahedron. My idea was to just cast the half of the dice twice and glue them together. I though about making a mold that will give 4 halves of a 
        octahedron and on each of my cast I can make 2 full octahedron. I though the maximum depth the 2.5CNC machine in the lab would go is 1inch and made a design
        that what to %75 of that design(75%). There was a lot of waiting there so I 3-d printed my mold while I waited my for my turn for the CNC to come. I then realized the maximum
        depth I had was 1cm and rescaled my mold accordingly. While cnc'in the mold took of from the surface so I had to do it for a 2nd with adding more tape.

        <br>
        After I cnc-ed my mold I mixed the 2 ingrediendt to make the rubber mold(the one that it's pinkish) and casted the viscous liquid into my mold for both
        CNC-ed(the one designed for a depth of 1cm) and my 3-d printed mold(designed for 1 inch depth screw, the height of the pyramid is 0.5inches)

                Here's the original mold designed for 1-inch. The pyramid is here 0.5inches thick. The size of this octahedron was ideal so
                I printed to o these molds and used them

        To be honest honest while making the molds I tried to be gently but didn't do something special  for eliinating bubles. I just put the stick in on places
        where I felt there bubles. Altough I was a little careless. I tried to cleana way the excess rubber on the 3dprint. I also added some easy remove spray.
        I don't know how but my 3-dprint mold came with only minor holes in, which made it perfect for making casting. Here's a photo of the mold from the 3-d print.
        I have no photo's of the smaller mold because the triangle sizes were small so I didn't care about it after I made and focused more on casting with the mold from the 
        3-dprinted one.

    <p>
      Also I wanted to make multiple octahedrons so I need more than 1 mold so I printed another 3-dprint and created 2 molds from my existing 3-D prints.
      I casted them and in total I casted 6 times in which I made 3 octahedrons. Here're the photo of the molds and octahedrons(I used glue to sick 2 sides of pyram.ds)

            I mixed acrylic with plaster to make these. One is blue the other red and the last one is blue-red mixture.

       For my Cast I was trying to make a somooth surface for the pyramid and looking for a material that would be durable for rolling over a table. I asked Nathan
       and he suggested me use plaster. I had to mix 32g for every 100g of plaster which is rpougly 1g H2O/3g Plaster ratio. On my first cast I sed 32/100 but on the others 
       I siply used 1/3. I weighed the cup by the palance and pured 32g water. To be accurate I had water on another cup and slowly poured it in the mixing cup, sometimes stoppinjg
       to see how many grams where there. I used a similar straategy to add plaster as well. On the manuals I think it says at least half of the plaster mix, the put other hald. I
       had plaster on another cup and slowly put in to the mixing cup witht he help of a rod. When it was around 1/2 of the toal grams I mixed then then poured till I had the neccesary
       amount of plaster in. To color my cast's I used acrylic in the lab to color it. For my first 2 cast's I used blue, then red, then mixed red and blue to get a purplish-color.
       I put the acyrlic always after I mixed the plaster and the water. Here's a photo of me puring water in to the cup.
    </p>

    <image src="photos-cads/pouring-water-in-the-cup.jpg" width="750" height="1000"></image>

    <p>
      After coloring the mixture, I gently poured the mixture into my molds making sure to eliminate molds. The mixture was liquid so I had no major holes.
      On one of my molds I put acyrlic while casting to see how it effect and my acrylic made a cavatity. After poured the mixture in, I used the little rod
      to sweep away the extra liquid sticking to the mold and tried to make a smooth surface. After that I just left my mold and came like 45 minutes later to get my cast.
      I knew it was time to get my cast, when the mixture in the cup has fully solidified.

      <br>

      Altough plaster was good to use it was too brittle and I was not confident in it to use as a die, so I tried metal casting.
      I though the rubber-molds wouldn't support metal but they did. I heated to oven and melted the metal there. I used gloves but the pan
      was still too hot to touch with the gloves(I could only hold it for 10-20seconds before I had to put it down on the table). On my first attempt
      the metal stayed liquid for like 1 minute which gave me enough time to put the pan on the table then pur onto my cast and I was happy with the result I got.

      After that I tried to melt metal for 2 or 3 times but on each of them metal solidifed before I could pour them into the mold so I gave up on my idea.
      Also the top surface of the metal is not flat at all and it would've been an challenge to attach 2 pyramids together. I had the problem of not-flat surface
      with plaster as well,  and though about puting a flat surface on top of the mold so that the cast came as flat. I never tried this but this still would've been a
      challenge for metals as the metal is pretty hot and the surface I will put has to withstand that. Here's a photo of my metal cast.

      Cad-ing the pyramid should've been as easy as making a square and extruding it by angle. However because I didn't know that fusion was giving the angle beetween the vertica≈ü
      axes and the line as the angle, I though the' horizontal line, I spent like an hour trying to figure thigns out and learned 3-d sketches exist in fusion(altough I didn't use them)
      only to realize my mistake with angles. Here's a photo explaining my problem
    </p>

    <image src="photos-cads/angle-problem.jpg" width="750" height="1000"></image>

    <p>
      Besides the problem I had with complementary angles everythig else was easy. I designed my pieces so tha tht eheigh of the pyramid was the half of the depth
      I though CNC machine could do, I made a %75 of that depth's indent in the mold and the side length of the pyramid were ‚àö2 times that of the heigh because of the geometry of
      octahedron. 

      For my big octahedron and my wax block with 4 traingles the mold  had a 4.5cm length and 3cm inner length.  Here're some photos from the cad design.

      For calculating the angle first I first found the heigh of the triangles then found the heigh of the pyramid then did inverse trig to found the angle. Because
      how fusion360 deals with angled Extrude's I did -(90-angle) to get the shape I wanted. Here's a photo of how I found roughly 54.7¬∞ angle.
