      <h2 id="light-sensor">The Reliable and Unreliable Light Sensor</h2>
      <a  href="#rotation-sensor" class="in-page-link">Rotation Sensor</a>

    <hr>
    <p>
        In my basktabll project with my friend we're planning a sensor that detecs wheather the ball passed through the net or not. To do this we though of using a light sensor with tube attached
        to it(the tube block lights coming from other places and allows a narrow angle to reach it). I first tested my idea with 1 light resistor. I created a classic voltage divider
        curciut with I guess 10kohm resistor and did some basic testing to make sure that the resistor was responding to light. I displayed my analogReads on the serial monitor. After some basic testing
        I have a cut a little rectangle from the black card-board and made a little tunel for resistor so that I block most of the light from other angles and only allow light near 90° to come in.
        During this testing I put the resistor horizontaly and simply moved my hand closer' and away from it testing how it responded. I also had a ruler so that I can see how far my hand was away from the ruler.
        In these testing I found that the shadow of my arm hovering the resistor, a person's shadow, how much the surface reflected light affected the readings on the resistor.
        <br>
        After experimenting with these, I decided to test range of the resistor. What I was trying to do was see a range of values where I can easily distinguish from the reading with no object infront of it.
        During these testing I realized that the light sensor is unreliable(I already knew from the it's documentation). It read 400 when there were no objects than 900 when I put my hand on it
        then 375 when I took it back then 425 while there was nothing on top of it. So I can confidently say that the light sensor reads X when there's no object infront of it.
        However when an object is placed or it distance is changed( and this objects is in the range of the sensor) by change in the values I can detectwheather objects went away or closer to the sensor.
        The wild nature of the transistor was also apparent when I was trying it on it's near-maximum range(I found this number to be 10cm but probally varies by somewhat) For example it read 400 when no object infront
        425 when a object is palced 10cm away then 417 when taken and suddenly jumping to 437 for no reason. So just by looking at the numbers it would be hard to find the distance of the object 
        if it's not too close. On our final project we'll have to detect the basketball ball going through the hoop which we'll se as a spike so our set-up should work. However we have the sensor with actual basketball going down at
        10m/s.
        <br>
        During the test with single light resistor I found the maximum distance(the maximum distance I was able to identify by change in numbers) was around 10cm which is too short for our requirements.
        It should work at least in the range of 15-30cm achieve our goal. Inspired by a yt video I watched,in which a guy uses multiple supersonic sensors to increase the devices range, 
        I've decided to put 4 of the light resistors in a square grid and connect them in series. The way I connected was I put 2 thermoresister together and twisted the wires on the middle and taped the twisted part.
        After that I aligned the resistors so they were on roughly the same height and taped all parts of the cable's that were connected so that other cables didn't distrupt the parelel connection.
        I did the same thing for another 2 thermo resistor's. Then I connected 1 of the 2 open wires of resistor pair in the same way and also taped the connected cables. Then I made sure the 2 resistor pairs were aligned
        put tape near the head of the resistors so it stayed together. I just had 2 open wires left which I used aligator clips to connect to my curcuit.

  <h2>The Black Tube and Placing the Resistor's in it.</h2>

  <p>
    Just putting 4 light resistor doesn't make a sensor that can detect an object (detect changes in light level) that's 30cm far ,as light comes from many directions.
    If I put a tube infront of the resistor grid, the tube will tube block of the most of light coming and only allow light coming from near-direct angles. To make sure 
    that only near-direct light reaches the resistor I used a black card-board I found on the lab and tried to cut a rectangular piece. I didn't measure it's size so I can't give
    but from my rough estimates it's at least 6cm long. After cutting the rectangle I bent around the grid and made a tube. Then I used a masking tape to secure. While making the 
    tube I first made a big hole that the grid can easily go in and out from. Then I slowly narrowed until it just stayed there. I don't use anything to secure the light resistors in to the tube.
    There are 2 open cables that for the ground and 5v. it doesn't matter which one I attach to the ground and which one to the 5V. The only  thing is that to avoid the 2 cables 
    connecting I bent them in opposite direction and attached the allegetor cables like that. Some part of the wires of the resistor's is also in the tube but I don't know how 
    much as I simply didn't measure.
    <br>
    To measure the limit of the resistor, I made a brown clay ball to mimick a basket-ball(it's smaller than a basketball ball obviously). I just did it by getting some
    clay and made a spherish shape. Then I put the tube down but tilted a little up due to the aligator clips. To fix this, I took a arduino-board-holder and taped the tube on the 
    flatter side of the holder. This way the tube was placed horizontal. Then with squihing the tube by my hand I the rough spot of the resistors. I put a ruler starting from the rough spot.
    This way I able to measure the distance of the object to the sensor(not the edge of the tube) to a value that's a multiple of the voltage across the light resistors.
    From my rough location of the resistor's I think there's 4.6cm length tube infront of the resistor's. I put the ball really close to the tube(roughly 4.6cm) and measured the arduino 
    reading. Then at each subsequent even number distance(6cm,8cm,10cm....) I put the ball and measured the distance until 30cm which was the length of ruler. I still get
    identifiable data around 30cm and could've continued but stopped. I except the sensors can sense object that maximum 34-36cm direct away from them

  <h2> Electronic Design and the Ohm Monster</h2>

  <p>
    When I read the datasheet for the resistor's it stated the data coming varied alot(yep it did) and it had a range of 10k-200kohm resistance(I thing I broke those numbers).
    During my inital testing with the single light resistor I used a 10k ohm resistor caused Nathan suggested that. On my design I have a constant resistor, than the resistor
    and I read the voltage beetween the constand light resistors. When I decided to do a 4 resistor set-up, ebcause ı put them in series I assumed a 50k ohm voltage will help
    me and on my initial design I used it. That's why I used a 47k ohm resistor I found on the lab. Here's the schematic of my deisgn(the resistor values do not reflect actual
    resistance of the resistors)

    <image src="photos_graphs(light resistor)/initial_curcuit_schematic.png" width="750" height="1000">

    With the current way I'm reading if I read a high value it means the resistance of the thermoe resistor's are gretaer than the fixed resistance. During testing when I was just using
    100k ohm fixed resistor I found out that even nothing was close to the sensor I still got reading int he 900's range which meant that there was big resistance in the light resistor's. 
    To have a bigger range of values I changed the 100k to a 1m ohm resistor and it made promise now I was getting values around 750 for no object but I wanted to increase more so connected 2
    1m ohm resistor's series(practicaly making them 2m ohm) and with this I was getting values from 350 to 1000 and reaching 1000 or more needed some series closement of the tube. 
    In the datasheet it states the range from 10k-200k and I was getting at least 175 kohm per light resistor when nothing was infront and some big number if I put something infront.
    Just for I force the clay ball to close the tube's face and when I used the multimeter even the 200M ohm version couldn't read. Practically speakign when an object is really close
    like (4.7cm, 0.1cm away from the tube) I get resistance in 10's of milions although I haven't tested this properly. Here's a photo of the a 22M ohm reading
    notice that the multimeter is on the 200M ohm setting.

    It was fun playing around with these big resistor values.

    <h2> Coding to get Result's</h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    On my coding side there isn't that much of hard or a technical thing, I have simple task of reading from A0(the analog sensor I choose) and displaying on the screen. 
    During initial testing succisive sensor values varied and were jumping up and own. for example 170, then 168,19,165,171 etc. To smooth these out and also have data speed
    that I can udnerstand I created a function to take averages of n reading(the function takes n as a input does the sampling accordingly).

    I've choosen float as my data type as it makes sense for avarage of sampling to be a decimal. I also give a 2ms delay beetween each sensor reading. My general code 
    is built on top of the arduino's basis analogRead example. I simply added "take_average_reading" function to it. While I was taking measurements, the data had to come in a speed
    that I can read and shouldn't contain a lot of fluctutions. For this I take avarage of 150 readings and recorded that(as you can see in the code snippet below)

  <h2> My Data</h2>
  <p>
    As I said before I placed the clay ball really close to the tube(roughly 4.6cm away from sensors) and the placed it even number away from the sensors(6,8,10cm etc.) While
    testing I had my 2M ohm constant resistor's set-up so that I can get a big range of values. Also the readings I get were influenced by the lab's light level and the light reflected
    by the table as some light also reached the sensors.

        <p>
          Here's my data table. Altough the avarage values I saw were float's and had 2 decimal points, data coming
          every 300ms was still hard for me to read those decimal values. That's I simply ğput the integer values I saw

          Here's the graph of my data
        </p>
      </div>
    </div><!--Row div finishes here-->
  </div>


  <p>
    When the clay ball is close to the tube it block nearlly all light coming in and light resistor's have a big resistances.
    As the ball moves away from the tube it blocks less of the light away and the voltage values decreases accordingly.
    As the ball moves away the distance change's effect becomes less and less, around 30-35cm(altough I haven't tested any value above 30cm) 
    it the sensors are no longer able to detect those changes. These ideas are reflected in tne data as well. The change in the value is bigger
    whent he ball is closer(like the difference beetween readings from 6cm and 8cm) while it's becomes less and less as we go farther away(like the difference
    beetween 28cm and 30cm distance).
    <br>
    The size of the object has an important role in these values. If it's bigger it'll block more light and the sensor might detect it fruther away
    while smaller obejct like marble's will be harder to detect as they obsturct less of the light. Also factor's like the general lighting in the room
    and how reflective the object is will also effect the range of the object. With my observation from the clay ball the maximum value I'll see is 1023 reading
    (because of the limit of analog read on arduino) and I'll reach this very close 4.6cm. After some distance to tube like 0.1mm till the tube start the sensor's
    won't be able to detect the changes, but the sensor is not designed for this kind of a requirement. Depending on the lighting of a room and the shape and size of an object
    the sensor will have around at least 25cm range of detection

    <p> 
      On the class Nathan showed some tilt sensors and after that I wanted to make a 2 axis-til sensor. To do that I had an idea of putting 2, 2-pairs of coper tape on
      the bottle and each pair serving as a capacative sensor for an axis. However I realized this would've crate some problems as when I power the X-axis's coper tabe
      the coper-tabe for the Y-axis's would also get charged. Then I aproached Nathan and he gave me the idea putting 2 bottle's together and each measuring the one axis.
      Besides 2-axis I also wanted my sensor to able to measure at least from vertical to horizontal which means I needed a container that had a smaller opening on the top 
      compared to the bottom to store the water. I only found 1 one of these cups on the maker-space and ditched my idea of 2-axis. Also the hours I wasted on trying to put an allegetor
      clip on coper wires meant I had no time to implement my idea. Here's a hand drawn sketch of me trying to write why a cap was needed to measure near-horizontal angles.

      <image src="capacitve_photos/Hand-writing-of-using-a-cap.jpg" width="750" height="1000">
      
      While I was puttingn water on the bottle I tried to make sure that the water level  reached the copper-tapes while also not spilling out when placed horizontally on the table. 
      Here's a photo that tries to explain this.
      <image src="capacitve_photos/explaining_how_much_water_I_put.jpg" width="750" height="1000"></image>

      I first made my design with a plastic cup I found on the lab. I cut some copper wire, put them close to each other, run the example code from the website and saw the data.
      I just did it so to test that as the area of the water changed on the copper wire my readings chnaged(it worked as I tilted more to the copper-tape side the readings increased).
      While testing with the cup I realized that due to how water stays horizontal compared to the shape of the water bottle it was becoming hard to see the differences on near-limit angles
      (on the plastic cup I couldn't do horizontal but as I reached it's limiting angle, the angle when water will spill, it become harder to see the differences). This was due to the circular shape
      and the wide copper-tapes. After that I decided to use really thing tapes so that I can mitigate this effect. Here's me trying to explain this.

    </p>

    <h3>Wasting Hours to Take a Reading</h3>
    <p>
      After I observed that due to the geometry of the circular design, it was harder to distinguish value near horizontal. I decided to put the thin copper tape I found on the lab 
      and atteched it to the water-container. After that I started doing some experimentation with numbers and realized because the surface was low the range of values I was
      getting went from 200-500 range to 150-300. I was fine with this and tried to measure the angle and the value I got(I'll explain my data measurement set-up later). On my testing
      I attach allegetor clips to the tape and these clips allways torn while I was testişng with thin-wire. I tried a lot of things but in the end wasted 3-4hours trying for the allegetor
      clips to stick to the tape. When I realized I couldn't continue with the thin-wires I took them of and put some wider ones and was oble to measure the angle vs analogRead values
      without a lot of problem. With this said I think if there's a way to physically amplify the readings and also have tubes whose height/radius is high, the sensors would become more precise.
      Also to solve the width problem and the curvature problem I thought about using a square or a rectangular design but never tested it.

    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
    <p>
      After I had my sensor and getting data matched my expectations, it was time for me to collect data. Besides wasting hours on attaching an allegetor clip to thin tape I had no major problems.
      I had 2 ideas on how I can measure angle to analogRead, the first one was to attach MPU6050 IMU on the bottom of the water-tube and use it's gyrsocpoes. However I learned that the sensor
      gave measurements of angular velocity and not rotation, altough I could've converted velocity into angles turned I decided to not do that as the sensor's imprecision's will add up and it was hard for me 
      to measure time(this path would've lead me to integral's). My 2nd(which I used for data measurement) was to use a angle meaurer and draw some lines representing some angles.
      The way I did was that I put an angle measurer on the big white-board and put dot's on every 10° starting from right horizontal angle. After that I extended these dots to make lines. 
      Here's a photo explaining for convinience I didn't put all the 15 dots on the paper for the 0°-140° range but on the white-board I did.

      I also put a dot on the center of the angles so I can have a pivot point to rotate the tube around. After all of this I moved a table right on the white-board and put computer there.
      My dots were a little hjigh and all of my electronics were connected to my computer so I had to move tube easily withput disxonnecting it from my computer.
      There was a white box that hold chalks in it, which also is magneted to the black-board. I put a board-eraser on top of it to make a flat surface for my tube.
      After that I aligned the top of the eraser with the pivot point I marked so that I asily turn the tube. Here's a set-up with the box and the eraser.

      It was hard for me while data collecting to hold the tube in a fixed plac,e read data from my computer and also write the data on to the board so that I can transfer later. I was reading
      data from my computer which were an average of 25 tries. Trying to get data was a little hard as hands touching the copper wire or tilting the tube on any axis that the tape's weren't on caused problems.
      That's why I got help from my friends and they've rotated the bottle every line and I recorded their readings. On my set-up 0° was positive x axis and the angles went counter-clokwise. 
      Here are a couple of photos from my data collection.

            Although when I recorded the data my friends hold the bottle, they did the same thing as this photo. They started from 0° then
            went to 140° where roughly the water started to not touch the copper wires.

    <h3>Electronics</h3>
    <p>
      There is no specfic thing I did on my electronics. I used pin 2 as the Tx pin and A0 as the analogRead pin. I put the socket-to socket wires and attached one of the socket wire
      to the sensor via the allegetor clips.
    </p>
    <h3>Coding</h3>
    <p>
      To get readings I used the example code from the courses website. Each data obviously varied from each other and like what I did with my light sensor,
      I created a take_average method and recorded my data with average of 25.
