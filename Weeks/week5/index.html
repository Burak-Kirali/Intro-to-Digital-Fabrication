    On week2 when I cad-ed a glue bottle without the cap I wanted to test how occurately I designed it. To test how accuretely I meassured the glue bottle and will my design ever fit in the cap 
    I decided to print it this week. It was wise to have printed something for my final project but because of my recent idea change I've decided not to do that.
    When I printed there were struts on a little bit hard to take places but the with the help of box cutter I was able to cut although I cut my finger a long the way.
    After I removed the struts I wanted to test wheather the cap from the original glue bottle will work or not. Although I haven't found the original bottle, I found 
    glue  bottle a little bigger than the mine and tested it's caps. I don't know have but it worked. Here is the<a href="../week2/index.html#glue%20bottle">link</a> for my documentation of the glue bottle.
    Also here is the stl file of the glue bottle. You can download it from<a href="photos_and_files/burak-glue-bottle.stl" download>here</a>

    In this week I wnated to scan soomething unordinary and had no idea what to scan. Inspire by the person who created a clay strucutre I tried to make Earth on clay(
      with my non-existing clay skills). I tried to replicate the shape of africa by making some part sticking out, which somehwat worked. AFter that I tried to add europe and Asia
      which just messed up with the clay. After that I made some indent and ended with the random shape I have. I then put it on the rotating piece infront of the scanner at the lab.
       The problem I had was that on the app there's a "excelent" mark which indicates that the object is close enough for a good scan while not too close for a bad scan. When I moved my earth-look,ing clay to that position the bottom wouldn't 
      show-up. To fix this I rotated the head of scanner a little down which fixed my problem. Also I played with the brightness feature on the app so that it scanned my object correctly.
      My scan had hole in the bottom as I assume that the scanner couldn't scan that part. Anyway I filled with the other app in the computer at science center. I unfortunately changed the shape
      of the clay after I scanned so I don't have a picture of the actual clay. However I have the a video of me recording the scanned piece on the cpmputer.

    For my final project I had no idea till this weak. My friends told me his idea and invited me to the project. The aim of the project
    is to detect where on the hoop does a basketball hits. This may sound simple but after a little bit of research it's challenging. Firstly we have 
    to find a way to detect where on the hoop does the ball hits. To do this, we thought of using force or presure sensors but their working principle is a little complicating.
    We don't need the exact measurement of the force but the readings on the sensors should force times a coefficeint so that we can locate where on the hoop the ball hit
    by the sensors readings. I searched online how can I do this, and I found that we have to use strain gauges. Strain gauges operate in the principle that when a force is 
    aplied to a surface the metal comrpoess or strectches a little and the strain gauge(which basicly is a resistor) changes in length acordingly which causes
    changes in resistances(I'm confident in my knowledge till here). After here I guess we have to use a whitestone bridge and measure voltage and amplify it so that
    arduino can read it. However I feel I'm stuck in my research and utulize the 2 sensors lessons on week6 and week7 to fletch out this idea. 

    <br>
    I feel that me and Demir have to a lot of testing this week to just understand how the ball hitting the hoop effects the sensors. Since our measurement will just be a 
    number representing how much a small area on the hoop bent, finding the location may not be as simple selecting the sensor with the highest reading.
    Also if the bent is homogenous on the hoop we have to think of putting little independent metal pieces to measure the force. Another thing we may have to consider
    is that one part of the hoop is attached to it's holder while the part is not and this may also effect our measurements.
    <br>
    In the project we'll but a hoop and built our project on it. I don't know how many strain gauges we'll use but if it's more than 6 we have to think about how to read
    data from them because there only 6 analog pins on arduino. What I imagine for our project is that an arduino board collects data from the sensors and do some 
    statistic to locate the place that the ball hit. Then this data is sent to a computer where a python program visualizes this(if we  can't come to this part
    lighting the LED's to show where the ball hit is also enough)
  </p>

  <h3>Timeline </h3>
  <p> 
    I hope that until 16th of July we figure out how the ball hitting the hoop effects the sensors. After that 2 week to built the addition to the hoop
    and coding required to locate where the ball hit. Then another week for a user-friendly pyhton aplication. This timeline is ambitious and doesn't take account any problems we 
    may face.
