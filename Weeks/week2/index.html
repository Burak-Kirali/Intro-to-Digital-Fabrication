	<h1> Buraks Experimentation With Pentagons and CAD-ing</h1>
	<hr>
	
	<h2> Why pentagons</h2>

	<pre >
This week for my press-fit proejct I wanted to experiment
with pentagons. I was inspired by the hexagonal
structure in the lab and wanted to try a shape with odd number
of sides. Even numbered polygons have sides parelel to each other
and are generally symetrical but odd-numbered polygons breaks this 
symetry and I wanted to see what kind of structures I may see arrive 
with the pentagon. I'm happy with the shape I've gotten. I could've 
added more pentagons but the laser-cutter was busy while I was at
the maker space so I only printed like 30-40 pentagons
24 was used on the final design while the rest was used to find the 
kerf and modify my design.

	<h2>Past Designs</h2>
	<pre> 
For all of my designs the side length of the pentagon was 30mm, 
fillet's radius for the corner was 10mm and the fillet radius
for the outer corners was 2mm. I didn't record my initial 
indent depth for the first time but for all the others,
it is 10mm. When cading my polygon, to make it's the cading
easier I wanted the lover side to be parelel with the x-axis.
To achieve this I had to cad  with an edge-polygon

<pre>
On my my first design the indent-width was too big and I assumed the laser laser-cutter
had a 0.65mm kerf and cadded my 2nd design with that. When I printed my v2, I tne 
width was too small and the pieces didn't go each other. Then I measured the thickness 
and width my caliber and altered my design until v6 with that(it took me 5 tries to 
understand the kerf was 0.2mm) the reason I had this many trials was that the card board
we use can sequaze if a little pressure is aplied by the caliber. That's why it was a hard
to precisely measure the indent-width but the thickness of all card-boards beside the fist one 
was 3.8mm. While I was cad-ing I didn't my pentagon, so thickness length was only used to determine 
indent width. Here are some photos of how I measured the indent length and thickness

	<h2> Some Problems
	</h2>
<pre>
On the class my teacher showed a way to mirror the indent-width 
to make the indent. However while cading what I realized was That
a change to a side didn't apply to another side so on my final cading
the indent-width was one whole line. Also to make the other 4 indents,
I used a 5-way circular pattern and a problem I faced there was that when 
I aplied the fillets after the pattern the symetry will break and a change
to the original indent-width was not aplied to other patterns. To fix this 
I aplied the fillets first then did the circular pattern then  did the 
trimming. I assume these problems occured due to fillets breaking constraints

An example of the mirror not aplied
In here I think the original indent- 
width was 4mm then I tried to change 
it to 3.6mm, but as you can see it's 
not aplied to the left part

			</div>
			<div class="col-6">
					<pre>






I couldn't find a version of the pentagon
with an asymetrical indent-width's. But I 
realized it at my v6, then made the neccesary
fixes for v7(the final version). On v6 there 
one side with 3.4mm indent length and when printed
those sides fitted together tight but not too tight
and not loose 
					</pre>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>



	<h2>The current design</h2>
	<pre>
For my current design I've used a card-board with 3.8mm thickness
0.2mm kerf, 2mm for inden't corner's fillet radius and 10mm for the 
radius of the corners of the pentagon with a 30mm side length. To make
the design more understandable and readable for me all of the numbers 
have a variable associated with them

While cading I wanted the drawing to be easy so I wanted to lower-side 
of the pentagon paralel to x-axis, the easiest way to make this is by 
edge-polygon and setting the number of sides to 5, then by sketch-dimensions 
I set the side length to 30mm.

	<pre>
The indent-width has to be centered on the edge and be one line. If I try to make it mirrored
I get the problem of smyetry not working as discussed earlier. To make the indent-width be 
one single line,I created a construction line 2 times indent-length that goes from the 
center of an edge to the center, then created a normal line that's perpendicular
to the previous line and added the constrains of being the mid-point

The indent-length is 10mm so this consturction line has a length of 20mm.

			<div class="col-4">

				<pre>
I just create a perpendicular line
and apply the midpoint constraint.
This assured that indent-width is 
centered and is 10mm away from the
edge.

				<pre>
The laser cutter will cut away from 
both edges of the ident so while I 
cadding I did thickness-2*kerf. 
Thickness is 3.8mm and kerf is 0.2mm
so a indent-width of 3.4mm on the design
I did not account for kerf on the 
pentagon's edges
				</pre>		
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<pre>
After setting the indent-width's length. I drew 2 perpendicular
lines from the edges of the indent-width to the edge. Since the 
indent-width is centered with indent-width and half the length of
the construction line is 10mm, these 2 lines had a length of 10mm.

After that I trimmed the part that'll be the indent and aplied a 2mm
fillet's. Because of the broken symetry problem disccused earlier, I 
aplied the fillet's first and selected the 5 lines. 2 edges, 2 fillets
and indent-width and did a 5way circular pattern by the center.

Now I have to trim the indent's from the pattern as the pattern did not
trim an apply the 10mm fillet to edges of the pentagon.

	<h1> Cading a chair, (cad-ed object1)</h1>

	<pre>
I wanted to cad something different for me that's why I choose
the chair at the lab.
	</pre>
	<img src="" width="750" height="1000">
	<pre>
I original wanted to cad the seat as one file, however, cading the 
specific shapes of the legs was a challenge so I split the design into 3
cads. The top seating part, the middle part and the legs. Each on the seat 
was unique to simplfy my design I choosed one of the legs and placed 4 around
the center. The legs had holes in it but again to simply I simply ignored them.
The top seating part is big square that a person would sit on. The legs,
meet the at the center and to simplfy my design and easily pattern the legs,
I've caded the part where the legs met as a different part. After cading these 3
parts I've assembled them on another file.

	</div>

	<pre>
The thickness for square part and the legs were luckliy both 11.8mm
besides the cad-ing of the center part 11.8mö was used to extrude
	</pre>

	<h2> Design of the Big Square</h2>
	<pre>
I meassured the length of the square with a ruler I found on the lab 
side length was 38.5cm and again using the ruler I found the fillet 
radius to be 4cm. The cad-ing was simple as it's just a square with
fillet's that extruded by 11.8m
